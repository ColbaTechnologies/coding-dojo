## ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What's Coding Cata

A code kata is a software development exercise in which the focus is not on solving a task or problem, but on learning new skills and developing successful routines. For each code kata, several solutions have to be found in order to learn from mistakes, gain experience and develop even better solutions.

Originally the term Kata comes from the Japanese and is used among other things in the martial art. Sometimes Kata is also mentioned in the course of continuous improvement processes, KAIZEN or lean approaches. But in contrast to these approaches it is not necessary to reach concrete goals or defined milestones; the way is the goal. Perfection through repetition of forms, attitudes, processes and patterns is the focus of a Kata. Transferred to a code kata, the solution of a task is not the end, but the beginning. Or in other words: With practice and repetition you become the master (of software development).

## üì® How to participate

If you want to join or participate in the Coding dojo only join to slack channel **#coding-dojo**

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How to start

- Clone the coding-dojo repository.
- Go to the folder of the current work in progress cata.
- Decide which language you prefer to develop the cata.
- If not exist, create a folder with the name of the language. JavaScript, Kotlin, Haskell...
- If is already code in there, put your name and work in there your solution
- Read carefully the details of the cata. Normally you will have recomendations and test cases.
- And start developing you approach.

Is not needed to have it perfect. **Done is better than perfect**

Finallay every Friday at 14.00 we have a sort meeting to exchange point of views, share approaches and learn.
